# Include the world from another package

* Update .rosinstall to clone this repository and run `rosws update`

```
- git: {local-name: src/aws-robomaker-hospital-world, uri: 'https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-hospital-world.git', version: ros2}
```
* Add the following to your launch file:
* Add the following include to the ROS2 launch file you are using:
```python
    import os
    from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
    from launch import LaunchDescription
    from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
    from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource
    def generate_launch_description():
        hospital_pkg_dir = get_package_share_directory('aws_robomaker_hospital_world')
        hospital_launch_path = os.path.join(hospital_pkg_dir, 'launch')
        hospital_world_cmd = IncludeLaunchDescription(
            PythonLaunchDescriptionSource([hospital_launch_path, '/hospital.launch.py'])
        )
        ld = LaunchDescription()
        ld.add_action(hospital_world_cmd)
        return ld
```

# Load directly into Gazebo (without ROS2)
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models:`pwd`/fuel_models
gazebo worlds/hospital.world
```

# ROS2 Launch with Gazebo viewer (without a robot)
```bash
# build for ROS2
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build

# run in ROS2
source install/setup.sh
ros2 launch aws_robomaker_hospital_world view_hospital.launch.py
```

# Building
Include this as a .rosinstall dependency in your SampleApplication simulation workspace. `colcon build` will build this repository.

To build it outside an application, note there is no robot workspace. It is a simulation workspace only.

```bash
$ rosws update
$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh
$ colcon build
```

# Notes
It is possible that the Gazebo model path does not work properly, try the next command before running:

```bash
$ source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.bash
```
